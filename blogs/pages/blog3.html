                  When we say the word ‘eCommerce’ what comes to mind? Is it the
                  world of online selling? Perhaps you think of a marketplace?
                  Or maybe you’re like us and the thing that comes to mind is
                  Amazon.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>THE JURASSIC ERA OF ECOMMERCE</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Online marketplaces date all the way back to the 90s,
                  specifically 1995. And while you may not think that was a long
                  time ago, it’s actually been 27 years, which is 100 lifetimes
                  in the tech world. So, you can imagine, the realm of eComm was
                  vastly different to what we know it today. When the internet
                  was conceived, numerous tech companies came up with their
                  homogenous or unique offering of consumer products and
                  services via the internet. In other words, these companies
                  attempted to create an online economy for the Americans of the
                  internet age. Such dot com companies garnered the attention of
                  the investors who bid massive amounts of money into such
                  companies with the notion of them being the future of the
                  internet. And, as expected, the valuation grew their market
                  worth over and above their actual value and this resulted in
                  an outrageous increase in their stock prices which eventually
                  collapsed in a deep dive domino effect. This market crash
                  became known as the dot com bubble. But you see, at the end of
                  the day, these companies were selling hope. Nothing more and
                  nothing less. Think Theranos but late 90s early 2000s. The
                  idea was great, the dream was one for the history books, but
                  the implementation was an epic failure. However, through all
                  of this, really one company managed to really rise out of the
                  ashes to become the biggest eCommerce company on our green
                  earth, and I'm sure you guessed it. Amazon.

                <h3>WILL AMAZON FOREVER REMAIN RELEVANT?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Let’s quickly go over Amazon’s founding story. It was founded
                  in 1995, in a garage, with the initial idea being an online
                  marketplace for books. Jump to 2000, Amazon changed its
                  business model and logo to become the world's first and
                  leading online marketplace to sell any product from A-Z with a
                  smile. So, you see, amazon didn’t change the game, it created
                  it. It truly is an accomplishment for one company, to not only
                  continuously be the industry leader, but to also innovate it.
                  It’s a skill which Amazon has mastered over the years. At the
                  end of the day, Amazon has always had one main ethos in mind,
                  Innovate, Create, and Transend. Furthermore, Amazon has its
                  eggs in a lot of baskets to generate its revenue, which
                  essentially means it’s more than just an eCommerce platform.
                  In addition to the eCommerce platform, it also has Amazon
                  Prime, Amazon Music, Audible, Kindle, and Alexa. And that’s
                  just for us consumers. They also have AWS and Amazon Robotics
                  that hold a big share of the B2B market in their respective
                  domains. So, to answer to question in short, yes Amazon will
                  always remain relevant in our books.

                  <p>
                    In a future where AI is geared towards helping us have a
                    better quality of life, Amazon’s investments in Ring,
                    eCommerce, Prime logistics, Prime videos, Prime Music,
                    Audible, Kindle, and Alexa secure their existence as a
                    company set to defend and grow in a dynamic market that is
                    unpredictable and evolving with every alternate day.
                    Amazon’s portfolio of assets best places it in a position of
                    being able to leverage its massive database of consumer
                    purchase behavior to make game-changing predictions by
                    implementing AI ML in a way that humans, so far, were unable
                    to comprehend. Amazons lead in such data centric decision
                    making ensures that it never misses out on spearheading the
                    next big bubble.

                <p>
                  Ecommerce was a game changer in shopping, but Amazon created
                  the game that so many dreamed of inventing. Bezos took his
                  vision and implemented it in a way that would be able to grow
                  in more ways than one, even without him at the fore front,
                  ensuring that Amazon will forever be the industry leader.

                  Are you choosing the right website development framework?
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  You might need a coffee for this one!<br />
                  You’ve overcome the initial procrastination and you are
                  finally geared up for your business. You need a website and
                  you do not know what to do! There are two potential options
                  you need to choose from - The CMS (content management system)
                  and custom web development. But let’s be honest, most of us
                  don’t get it!<br /><br />
                  According to IDC, 60% of market leaders will have systemic,
                  structured digital innovation plans and investments in place
                  by 2027. Without going digital in the 21st century, growth,
                  scale, agility, and resilience are next to impossible. But
                  what should be the right choice for a business when it comes
                  to a website? It depends on four major questions:<br /><br />
                  1. Are you looking for customization?
                  <br />
                  2. Is UI/UX and Performance at the top of your priority list?
                  <br />
                  3. Is Scalability and Security of website your major concern?
                  <br />
                  4. What is the Time and Cost of your website development?
                  <br />
                  5. How complex is your website going to be?
                </p>

                <br />
                <p style="font-weight: 700">Design</p>
                <p>
                  We are not unacquainted with the immense popularity of CMS or
                  content management systems when it comes to business needs.
                  Laymen can opt to use these platforms to create new websites,
                  let alone citizen developers or experienced ones. CMS has an
                  upper hand, given its ease of usability, functionality, and
                  cost of development. But, if you want to meet your long-term
                  demands within your website and create designs based on the
                  specifications of individual projects, custom code is the
                  option you should be going for.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p style="font-weight: 700">Easy Deployment</p>
                <p>
                  CMS assists firms in gaining early adopters, validating and
                  designing ideas, ensuring seamless integration throughout the
                  lifecycle, and ensuring speedier development and delivery.
                  Custom development projects, alternatively, necessitate prior
                  effort in order to achieve an effective framework and put an
                  appropriate design for the target audience in their business.

                  <p>
                    If you want to launch a web resource, a custom code website
                    takes about 120-1000 hours on average. On the other hand,
                    with prototypes and preset templates already in place, CMS
                    is a time saver, if you’re on the clock.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>Security</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    If security is a primary priority for your brand,
                    custom-built websites outperform CMS platforms in general.
                    CMS frameworks rely mostly on third-party security, but a
                    custom coded site is built from the ground up. So, security
                    is only in your hand. However, if your website does not have
                    highly confidential information, most CMS infrastructures
                    work out just fine.

                  The CMS infrastructure helps you navigate your site easily as
                  the interface is super user-friendly. So most often, if your
                  website needs some minor changes and content update, you can
                  just choose CMS. If you’re not able to get a hang of the
                  website, most often a customer service call will fix it. That
                  being said, custom-coded frameworks are not entirely difficult
                  but a tad bit cumbersome for citizen developers to maintain
                  while catering to website development. However, there’s a
                  bright side, given you know to work around your websites or a
                  dedicated team of developers, it won’t need any third-party
                  interjection.

                <p>
                  Cross-platform functionality is important in today’s day and
                  age as most E-commerce plug-ins are next to impossible on CMS
                  framework. Scalability will often not be a big problem for
                  you, as most CMS platforms like Shopify, Webflow, WordPress
                  web development services etc. allow minor plug-ins if that’s
                  what you’re looking for. But if API integrations and major
                  plug-ins are required for your business, then adopting a CMS
                  framework may restrict you to the infrastructure of the
                  platform and make it difficult to increase the site's
                  features.

                  While each has its own pros and cons, for a long, durable, and
                  secured point-to-point integration, custom development is
                  recommended. While it is not untrue that the initially a
                  custom website development prices are higher than CMS, it’s
                  always more accessible, customized, and cost-efficient in the
                  long run. However, if you are looking for flexibility,
                  maintenance, and a budget-friendly website development cost,
                  CMS can be a fair choice. If you’re looking to get started and
                  have more questions about which kind of CMS might work better

                  When we say the word ‘eCommerce’ what comes to mind? Is it the
                  world of online selling? Perhaps you think of a marketplace?
                  Or maybe you’re like us and the thing that comes to mind is
                  Amazon.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>THE JURASSIC ERA OF ECOMMERCE</p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Online marketplaces date all the way back to the 90s,
                  specifically 1995. And while you may not think that was a long
                  time ago, it’s actually been 27 years, which is 100 lifetimes
                  in the tech world. So, you can imagine, the realm of eComm was
                  vastly different to what we know it today.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  When the internet was conceived, numerous tech companies came
                  up with their homogenous or unique offerings of consumer
                  products and services via the internet. In other words, these
                  companies attempted to create an online economy for the
                  Americans of the internet age.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Such dot com companies garnered the attention of investors who
                  bid massive amounts of money into these companies with the
                  notion of them being the future of the internet. Their
                  valuations grew their market worth over and above their actual
                  value, and, as expected, it resulted in an outrageous increase
                  in their stock prices which eventually collapsed in a
                  deep-dive domino effect. This market crash became known as the
                  dot com bubble.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  But you see, at the end of the day, these companies were
                  selling hope. Nothing more and nothing less. Think Theranos
                  but late 90s early 2000s. The idea was great, the dream was
                  one for the history books, but the implementation was an epic
                  failure.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  However, through all of this, really one company managed to
                  rise out of the ashes to become the biggest eCommerce company
                  on our green earth, and I'm sure you guessed it. Amazon.

                <h3>Will Amazon forever remain relevant?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Let’s quickly go over Amazon’s founding story. It was founded
                  in 1995, in a garage, with the initial idea being an online
                  marketplace for books. Jump to 2000, Amazon changed its
                  business model and logo to become the world's first and
                  leading online marketplace to sell any product from A-Z with a
                  smile. So, you see, amazon didn’t change the game, it created
                  it.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="part-3">
              <div class="inner-part">
                <div>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    It truly is an accomplishment for one company, to not only
                    continuously be the industry leader, but to also innovate
                    it. It’s a skill that Amazon has mastered over the years. At
                    the end of the day, Amazon has always had one main ethos in
                    mind, Innovate, Create, and Transend.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Amazon has its eggs in a lot of baskets to
                    generate its revenue, which essentially means it’s more than
                    just an eCommerce platform. In addition to the eCommerce
                    platform, it also has Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Audible,
                    Kindle, and Alexa. And that’s just for us consumers. They
                    also have AWS and Amazon Robotics that hold a big share of
                    their respective B2B market domains.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    So, to answer to question in short, yes Amazon will always
                    remain relevant in our books.
                  </p>

                <h3>What will the future of Amazon look like?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  In a future where AI is geared towards helping us have a
                  better quality of life, Amazon’s investments in Ring,
                  eCommerce, Prime logistics, Prime videos, Prime Music,
                  Audible, Kindle, and Alexa secure their existence as a company
                  set to defend and grow in a dynamic market that is
                  unpredictable and evolving with every alternate day. Amazon’s
                  portfolio of assets best places it in a position of being able
                  to leverage its massive database of consumer purchase behavior
                  to make game-changing predictions by implementing AI ML in a
                  way that humans, so far, were unable to comprehend. Amazon's
                  lead in such data-centric decision-making ensures that it
                  never misses out on spearheading the next big bubble.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  ECommerce was a game changer in shopping, but Amazon created
                  the game that so many dreamed of inventing. Bezos took his
                  vision and implemented it in a way that would be able to grow
                  in more ways than one, even without him at the fore front,
                  ensuring that Amazon will forever be the industry leader.

                <br />
                <p>
                  When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he immediately wanted to
                  rebuild the company’s then-tarnished image.
                  <br /><br />
                  And that’s exactly what happened.
                  <br /><br />
                  Apple defined its identity by featuring some of the greatest
                  thinkers and iconic figures in history, creating a sense of
                  belonging among its customers. This ultimately lead to the
                  unwavering loyalty we see in Apple users today. Furthermore,
                  it showed the world that Apple played an integral role in
                  allowing creative minds to reach the pinnacle of their success
                  by simply creating the tools they need.

                <h3>Dove’s "Real Beauty Sketches"</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  In 2004, Dove wanted to branch out and explore what beauty
                  meant to women. After a market survey they found that only 2%
                  of women thought they were beautiful. As a result, Dove
                  changed its brand’s messaging to focus on empowering women’s
                  self-esteem by showcasing real women in their campaigns rather
                  than supermodels.
                  <br /><br />
                  Dove's campaign was a game changer as it did exactly what
                  their audience wanted to see. Not only did it challenge
                  existing beauty norms and spark conversations about
                  self-esteem, but it allowed Dove to establish itself as a
                  brand that makes beauty a factor to be proud of rather than a
                  concern.
                  <br /><br />
                  Furthermore, as the only brand to not conform to industry
                  norms, Dove received tons of free publicity which only
                  strengthened its identity as a brand for real people.

                <br />
                <p>
                  A comical take on men for a change, old spice wanted to create
                  a campaign character that appealed to both men and women.
                  <br /><br />
                  Launched during the 2010 Superbowl with over 40 million views
                  on YouTube at the time, it’s safe to say “The Man Your Man
                  Could Smell Like” was an instant hit. But the campaign helped
                  reposition Old Spice as a hip contemporary brand.

                <h3>Always’ "Like a Girl"</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  A true depiction of gender stereotypes that young girls face,
                  this Always ad was a breath of fresh air as it celebrated the
                  resilience of young girls.
                  <br /><br />
                  Like a girl. It’s a phrase we’ve all heard, and many of us
                  have sadly used. And at its core, it’s an insult that suggest
                  that girls are weaker than boys.
                  <br /><br />
                  Always took this phrase and created one of the greatest
                  campaigns in marketing history to ever exist. It challenged
                  the everyday stereotypes by redefining what is means to do
                  something “Like a Girl” with one simple question "When did
                  doing something "Like a Girl" become an insult"?
                  <br /><br />
                  As a result, Always received an overwhelming amount of support
                  and positivity, with the ad going on to win several awards for
                  its positive impact on society.

                <h3>H&M’s "Close the Loop"</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  For years, H&M has been criticized as a fast fashion brand
                  that isn’t as eco-friendly as it claims to be. The “Close the
                  Loop” campaign was the brands first step towards
                  sustainability.
                  <br /><br />
                  The aim was to promote sustainable fashion and emphasize the
                  importance of a circular economy.
                  <br /><br />
                  Not only did the ad represent diversity with models of
                  different ages, races, gender, etc., but it emphasized that
                  H&M was a brand that supported individuals with distinct and
                  unique styles. More importantly, the ad ended with a message
                  we very rarely see in the fashion industry- encouraging people
                  to donate unwanted clothes to its stores.

                  Colors are everywhere. They affect our emotions and behaviors.
                  Choosing the right colors for your brand identity can trigger
                  the desired action from a consumer.<br /><br />
                  If you’re looking to make a strong brand identity, this is it!
                  Do you know that the most common favorite color is blue? If
                  no, you’re welcome and if yes, there’s more you can
                  discover.<br /><br />
                  You see, color psychology in logo design is a fascinating
                  little enigma. Every color has a meaning, a personality, a
                  theme, and a feeling. Let’s take a simple example. Has it ever
                  occurred to you why surgeons wear blue or green scrubs? It’s
                  because it soothes the eye, and lessens emotional fatigue. In
                  short, it refreshes their vision while they constantly see red
                  in the operating rooms.<br /><br />
                  More often than not, blue and green are used as de-stressing
                  colors in the world of psychology. In the center of every big
                  brand identity, there is a recognizable logo with a suitable
                  color. When we say McDonald’s, you already have the huge
                  arches of M in yellow against the red backdrop right in your
                  mind. You’re visualizing it! This is the power of color.

                <p>
                  Additionally, to capture the attention of your target
                  audience, a color scheme is step one. Whether you are branding
                  or rebranding, you have to do it strategically. Moreover, all
                  your favorite brands became giants with well-designed logos.
                  The color, typeface, and shapes are used to trigger the
                  emotions of their customers. Henceforth, it encourages them to
                  buy the products.

                  <h3>HOW TO PICK YOUR BRAND’S COLOR:</h3>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Take a pause before you start the process of branding or
                    rebranding. Think about the message you want your brand
                    identity to convey. What particulars do you want to
                    highlight and put under the spotlight? Are you speedy like
                    postal delivery? innovative like the IT companies?
                    compassionate like a non-profit non-governmental community?
                    Consecutively, brand identity aspects that your audience
                    finds appealing must be at the top of this list. In
                    addition, colors help consumers categorize businesses, their
                    products, and their services. Also, they can identify which
                    are more to their liking. Do you know what you want your
                    brand identity to signify? Great! you can start thinking of
                    the color characteristics.

                <h3>IS THAT IT OR THERE'S MORE TO THE BRAND STORY?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  There are two other things we cannot forget. Color psychology
                  in good logo designs also has cultural associations and
                  industry trends. Cultural associations happen when certain
                  communities prefer a particular type of style. Let us break it
                  down for you. Here's an example of color and culture. In the
                  West, people wear black for funerals. Whereas, in some Asian
                  and Middle-Eastern cultures, people wear white. Polar opposite
                  choices in three intertwining cultures! So, do the market
                  analysis and tap its culture before you make your grand entry.
                  DO RESEARCH RIGHT! Ultimately, the success of any logo is
                  defined by many things. It includes quality, shape, color,
                  font, and how well it suits the brand identity. Attractive
                  colors for logos do play an important part. Nonetheless,
                  designing and marketing your brand is a game changer. This is
                  where a digital marketing company can lend you hand. With deep
                  industry knowledge, a digital marketing company like TriosCo
                  can set you up. This includes graphic designers and brand
                  managers. They will understand not just your customer but your
